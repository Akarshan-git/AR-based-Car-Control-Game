# AR-based-Car-Control-Game
This game is a basic game based on Augmented Reality technology , the game is targeted towards people suffering with neural conditions like 'Parkinson's syndrome' where its hard for one to control their muscle movement.
The game could act as an exercise to develop motor skills and a breakthrough into the world of gaming for specially abeled people . 

To run the game execute working,py file in pycharm or vscode .
I hope you appreciate the attempt and work on this tech for further improvements.
